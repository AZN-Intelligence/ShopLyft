# ðŸ›’ ShopLyft - AI Grocery Shopping Optimizer

ShopLyft is an AI-powered grocery shopping assistant that optimizes your shopping across Woolworths, Coles, and ALDI to save time and money.

## Features

- **Multi-store optimization**: Find the best combination of stores to visit
- **Price comparison**: Compare prices across all major Australian supermarkets
- **Route optimization**: Minimize travel time between stores
- **Click & Collect integration**: Automatic eligibility checking with minimum spend requirements
- **Savings calculation**: Shows total savings compared to shopping at a single store
- **Smart substitutions**: Handles product substitutions with clear flagging

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up your OpenAI API key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Run the agent**:
   ```bash
   python meta-agent/agent.py
   ```

4. **Test the agent**:
   ```bash
   python test_agent.py
   ```

## Usage Example

```
You: Shopping list: milk, bread, eggs, bananas. Location: -33.871, 151.206

Agent: [Generates optimized shopping plan with:
- Store route optimization
- Item assignments per store
- Click & Collect eligibility
- Total savings calculation
- Travel time estimates]
```

## AI Agent Tools

The agent uses the following tools to optimize your shopping:

- `fetch_prices()` - Get prices for items across stores
- `store_locator()` - Find nearby stores for each retailer
- `distance_matrix()` - Calculate travel times between locations
- `clickcollect_rules()` - Check Click & Collect eligibility
- `cart_bridge()` - Create carts for each retailer
- `persist_plan()` - Save the generated shopping plan
- `log_event()` - Track optimization steps

## Configuration

The agent is configured with:
- **Max iterations**: 16 (sufficient for complex optimization)
- **Optimization weights**: 20% time, 80% cost (configurable)
- **Max stores**: 3 (Woolworths, Coles, ALDI)
- **Currency**: AUD
- **Timezone**: Australia/Sydney

## Hackathon Compliance

- âœ… Uses mock JSON data only (no live scraping)
- âœ… All code in public repository
- âœ… ConnectOnion framework for AI agent
- âœ… Comprehensive optimization algorithms
- âœ… Ready for demo and pitch

## Next Steps

This is the core AI agent setup. For a complete application, you would also need:
- FastAPI backend with REST endpoints
- React frontend for user interface
- Enhanced optimization algorithms
- Real-time price data integration
